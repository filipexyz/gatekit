# SDK Changelog Generation

You are generating a PR description for the **@gatekit/sdk** package update.

## Your Task

1. **Compare current SDK repo with new generated SDK**:

   The SDK repo has been cloned to `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/sdk-repo/` and new files copied from `generated/sdk/`.

   ```bash
   cd $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/sdk-repo
   git diff --staged
   ```

   This shows the differences between the old SDK (in the repo) and new SDK (just copied).

2. **Read contract metadata**:

   ```bash
   cat $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/generated/contracts/contracts.json
   ```

3. **Understand what changed**:
   - New API endpoints added to SDK
   - Changed method signatures
   - New types extracted
   - Breaking changes in contracts
   - Removed functionality

4. **Generate PR title and description**:
   - Write PR title to `/tmp/sdk-pr-title.txt` (single line, no markdown)
   - Write PR body to `/tmp/sdk-pr-body.md` (full markdown description)

## Output Format

**File 1: `/tmp/sdk-pr-title.txt`** (Single line, no emojis, descriptive)

```
Update SDK with [brief description of main changes]
```

Examples:

- "Update SDK with webhook notification support"
- "Update SDK with breaking changes to message API"
- "Update SDK with new platform capabilities"

**File 2: `/tmp/sdk-pr-body.md`** (Full markdown description)

Write a GitHub PR description to `/tmp/sdk-pr-body.md` with this structure:
